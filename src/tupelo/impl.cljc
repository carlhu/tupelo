(defn spy
  "A form of (println ...) to ease debugging display of either intermediate values in threading
   forms or function return values. There are three variants.  Usage:

    (spy :msg <msg-string>)
        This variant is intended for use in either thread-first (->) or thread-last (->>)
        forms.  The keyword :msg is used to identify the message string and works equally
        well for both the -> and ->> operators. Spy prints both <msg-string>  and the
        threading value to stdout, then returns the value for further propogation in the
        threading form. For example, both of the following:
            (->   2
                  (+ 3)
                  (spy :msg \"sum\" )
                  (* 4))
            (->>  2
                  (+ 3)
                  (spy :msg \"sum\" )
                  (* 4))
        will print 'sum => 5' to stdout.

    (spy <msg-string> <value>)
        This variant is intended for simpler use cases such as function return values.
        Function return value expressions often invoke other functions and cannot be
        easily displayed since (println ...) swallows the return value and returns nil
        itself.  Spy will output both <msg-string> and the value, then return the value
        for use by further processing.  For example, the following:
            (println (* 2
                       (spy \"sum\" (+ 3 4))))
      will print:
            sum => 7
            14
      to stdout.

    (spy <value>)
        This variant is intended for use in very simple situations and is the same as the
        2-argument arity where <msg-string> defaults to 'spy'.  For example (spy (+ 2 3))
        prints 'spy => 5' to stdout.  "
